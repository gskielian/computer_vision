opencv scripts for pick-and-place

includes research materials where relevant

targeted at mac OSX mavericks python2.7

opencv installed with homebrew.... each dependency was installed manually .. in this case, eigen, qt, and  a reinstall of cmake.  in some cases, numpy / scipy will need to be installed as well




using static images:

corner.py -- foundation functions for edge detection sloppy but reasonably quick
good_corner -- just a demo from the tutorial... pretty accurate but savagely slow.
